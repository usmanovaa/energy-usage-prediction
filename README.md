## Predicting Building Energy Usage

The aim of the project is to develop an accurate model of metered building energy usage in such areas as chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters based on historic usage rates and observed weather over a three-year timeframe.

### Why is this important? 

Predicting building energy usage can help to understand if the improvement of building efficiencies brings positive impact. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies that will help to reduce future energy costs and emissions.

### What is the objective of the machine learning model?

We aim to minimise the difference between the real energy consumption and the energy usage estimated by our model. Model performance is estimated with the:

1. Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (main)

2. Mean Squared error (mse)

3. Root Squared of the mean squared error (rmse)

4. R-squared (r2)
